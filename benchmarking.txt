Benchmarking web frameworks.
-------------------------------------------------------------

The first step to uilding highj performance web apps is benchmarking them. The simplest 
benchmarking tool is `ab`, which stands for Apache Benchmark, which is bundled with apache
web server. So if you are on *nix system, there is a good chance that you already have this nifty benchmarking tool available.

What are we benchmarking?
---------------------------------------------------

This is a quick and dirty alalysis, and by NO MEANS claims to be scientific. Its aim is more to give a general
overview of web application performance, and to explain how benchmarking works, not as a comparative study.

We are benchmarking,

0. A Html Page
1. A Django Application
2. A Php Application
3. A Symphony Application
4. A rails application
5. Frontpage of Wordpress
6. Frontpage of a basic Django blog.

How are we benchmarking?
----------------------------------------------

We have a EC2 Instance running as our web and database server (Both on the same machine). The `ab` command is run from another EC2 Instance in a different availibilty zone.
All the applications talk to the same database. All applications except the blogs, show the same thing. 

There are two tables in our database, `Department` and `Employee`, with a few entries. Our applications show a department and its Employees.
