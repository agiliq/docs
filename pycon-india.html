[Pycon India](http://in.pycon.org/2009/displayschedule/) [concluded last weekend](http://pycon.blogspot.com/2009/09/pycon-india-receives-fantastic-response.html) at [Indian Institute of Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Science), Bangalore.

There have been so many python/django conferences recently, I have been tracking them literally all through the year. If you are in India, hey another one in India, [SciPy India](http://scipy.in/) just got announced. Week long, with sprints.

Pycon India was attended by around 350 people and had 30 talks. I have attended many more conferences, but this one was different. This one was where real people, the real developers gave talks and socialised. No enterprise BS, just the real thing*.

There were a vast majority of [good talks](http://in.pycon.org/2009/displayschedule/). However, I could only attend and appreciate a few. [Strand use of Python](http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/43/) involved explaining how they journeyed from having a little Jython code to hook up stuff to where they have a significantly large Jython code base, was quite interesting. There was a talk on "[Idiomatic Python](http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/32/)" from some one who did python at home, altho' the only thing his university expected is "C that runs on Turbo C (which is not really a language)". There was a talk on [design patterns](http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/30/) that explained various design patters: Singleton, Iterator, Factory Method, Strategy, observer, decorator. Creating a singleton using generators is a nice little thing I got out of this talk. The talks on using Build out for deployment and various testing frameworks of Python, and the keynote by  [Prabhu Ramachandran](http://in.pycon.org/2009/delegatefull/301/), are some other talks I would have liked to attend. A long session of [Introduction to Python](http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/15/) by a few experts, should have helped a lot of the begginers. I, along with 2 fellow Hyderabad django developers, presented a [talk on Django](http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/60/).

The event was well organised in many ways. It could have been better in some areas tho'. Connectivity and electrical points to charge laptops were short of the need. Surely, a real time twitter stream from the event could benefit a lot. And, it shouldn't take a lot to keep the site up! While infrastructure can be improved for the next event, surely it is a superb start in the right direction. There are quite a few companies, that work on Python in the [Indian valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_of_India), this event is likely going to be big pretty soon.

*PS: This should perhaps come as a nudge to Joel and Jeff to conduct [Stackoverflow dev days](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/05/12.html) in India too; after all, here is where stackoverflow gets the [third highest traffic](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/where-in-the-world-do-stack-overflow-users-come-from) from.

If you are a good developer from India reading this, hey, we are hiring!. We develop Web application in Django. We do Software Engineering and not, [layers of hacks](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9mw5n/ask_who_else_feels_their_code_is_hacks_upon/).

We believe in what [Steve Jobs says](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html).

> "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life. The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do"

or, as [DHH says](http://holtsblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/dhh-keynote-surplus-go-dubai-and.html),

> "The most depressing thing I can hear is... "it's just a job". How depressing is that? You spend 8, 10, 12 hours per day there. and it's "just a job"?
 
If it stikes a chord, you may want to send us your resume. You must be good in some programming language and must at least have exposure to Python. We offer inturn, great working environment, competitive package and huge 22" monitors to work with!
